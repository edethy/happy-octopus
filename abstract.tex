In this thesis, I created and utilized a dataset to determine the interpretability of
open source facial recognition algorithms as judged by the NetworkDissection technique.
Determining the interpretability of these networks required constructing a dataset with
labelled examples of disentangled facial features such as nose, eye, mouth, etc. Additionally,
I created a dataset of skin tones to test for skin tones as a concept in the networks.

In addition to the technical work of this thesis, I researched the policy implications
of network interpretability techniques and whether or not policy should require that networks
provide meaningful insight into their behavior.
